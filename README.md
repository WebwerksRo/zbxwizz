# ZbxWizz

**ZbxWizz** is a powerful and flexible tool for managing Zabbix configurations at scale. It allows you to **import, transform, and export** Zabbix data using a spreadsheet-like interface, making bulk operations simple and error-free.

## Usage
Clone the repository anywhere on your machine and just open the `index.html` file with your browser. A local web server is not required, but you can use one if you want. 

You will also need to disable CORS. Depending on the browser, you should consider installing and extension to disable CORS.

An Electron version is in the making, so stay tuned.
